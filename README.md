# tidydataproject

run_analysis.R takes the data from the UCI HAR dataset, in your R working directory, and outputs a file with the mean of each variable by subject and activity. The file should named "tidydata.txt" and you can load it into R with the command read.table("tidydata.txt",headers=TRUE).
